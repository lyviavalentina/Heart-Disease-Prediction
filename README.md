# Heart Disease Prediction Using Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The goal is to leverage data analysis and predictive modeling to assist in identifying individuals at risk of heart-related conditions.

## Features
Data preprocessing and feature selection.
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
  * Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
  * Matplotlib for data visualization.
  * Scikit-learn for machine learning models.

## Dataset
The project uses the publicly available Heart Disease Prediction dataset, containing medical and demographic data of patients.
